A huge desire to learn further, progress, and step up to every opportunity presented. Working at Glasswall I have worked as a Junior Core Developer for 2 years rising to challenges at SRE. Taking opportunities such as leading a squad for projects and developing prototype products during spare time. I have experienced companies in the crowdfunding phase such as Edge of Belgravia leading to a successful campaign to having short term experiences with Societe Generale, Accenture. Outside of technology, I have run a campaign representing the Liberal Democrats for my Council and made a gain of 3.1%.
